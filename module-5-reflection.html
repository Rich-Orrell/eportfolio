																		<h3>Submission</h3>
																		<p>During the course of this module, I have learned a lot about what it means to work on a project in a team, as well as understanding parts of project management methodoligies.  The case study that the project work was based around provided plenty of context around different areas to consider. From the budget and time constraints to the customer’s ethical concerns, it allowed the team to put many of the skills and techniques learned this module into practice. For example, the first few units of the module included a collaborative discussion around the reasons for project failure. I identified lack of cooperation, task difficulty, and task prioritisation as my three biggest factors for a project failing. Working on this early on allowed us to take these into consideration when undertaking project work. We ensured to have Zoom meetings at least once a week, as well as keeping in constant communication on WhatsApp about how we were progressing, as well as any queries we had. This meant that we were never stagnating when doing our assigned tasks as we always had people to bounce ideas off of. The other ways we ensured that the project ran smoothy were to identify which parts of the project were most important and ensure that those tasks were given appropriate resourcing and time to complete.</p> 
                                    <p>Early on in the project we established what each other’s strengths were in order to delegate tasks efficiently. I volunteered to take on the work developing the Python application, as I feel confident in my development skills. As I was the only one working on the Python application my work was more isolated, as the rest of the team were undertaking tasks which directly fed into what others were doing. Despite this I felt it was still important to detail to my teammates what I was working on, as well as hearing what they were doing in their areas. This was a very useful practice, as they were able to alleviate any tunnel-vision I was having about particular components of the project, and I was able to provide feedback on the work they were doing. </p>
                                    <p>My part of the group presentation was simply demonstrating the functionality of the cost estimation program I had designed, and I felt I did a good job presenting it, however in hindsight I feel I could have done a better job of communicating the uses of the program to non-technical users. In this module I have learned that dealing with stakeholders can be a very delicate practice. In the example of the case study, upon hearing the pitfalls in the project, the stakeholders were very upset and threatened legal action if it was not resolved. Demonstrating functionality of software to stakeholders should be used to evidence that their needs are being understood and addressed (Stellman, 2005), and a technical breakdown to a non-technical audience may not be appreciated. In future, taking time to consider what stakeholders would like to achieve and understand from a meeting or presentation will be a valuable skill.</p>
                                    <p>Outside of the larger case-study work, I have learned a lot from the weekly unit work this module. I was very interested in the unit regarding Pytest and test-driven development. When testing Python scripts in the past I would manually enter values into the system every time it was run to test functionality. This can be time consuming as in the case of the case study work for this module, around 8 different values would need to be entered before being able to test the reporting function. Using Pytest allowed for much more efficient test management, as well as a much more comprehensive output than the standard terminal error messages. Pytest has a rich collection of plugins and automation capabilities (Oliveria, 2018) which I would like to make use of in future work.</p>
                                    <p>Another concept which I feel I have learned a lot from in this module is user experience. In software development it is easy to be hung up on the technical, back-end aspects of the software, rather than thinking about how a user would understand and use it for the first time. I feel like this is something I can learn from in my future work. Users can have emotional reactions to a piece of software based on factors such as the usefulness, convenience, and aesthetics (Van der Linden, 2019), and I feel that my previous work has been lacking in these aspects. Addressing all of these factors will be difficult to do in the timescale of a standard module, but I feel it will be helpful to give them consideration once the core functionality is in place.</p>
                                    <p>In conclusion, I feel like I have made strides in my understanding of project management and dealing with users/customers as a result of this module, and I look forward to the opportunity to do it again in future.</p>
