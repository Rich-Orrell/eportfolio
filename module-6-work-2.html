																		<p>Q - Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the organisation discussed in the assessment?</p>
                                    <p>GDPR: UK based company which takes digital orders from customers</p>
                                    <p>PCI-DSS: Once digitisation project is complete they will be taking online payments</p>
                                    <p>HIPAA: The business creates food products</p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>Q - Evaluate the company against the appropriate standards and decide how would you check if standards were being met?</p>
                                    <p>GDPR: The business does not have a reliable place for storing customer data, meaning it can be at risk of a security breach</p>
                                    <p>PCI-DSS: They currently meet standards as they are not currently taking online payments.</p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>Q - What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?</p>
                                    <p>GDPR: Adopt a secure cloud storage solution</p>
                                    <p>PCI-DSS: Once the digitisation project is complete, ensure a business firewall is installed and configured by an IT professional.</p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>Q - What assumptions have you made?</p>
                                    <p>GDPR: Current infrastructure is not secure due to old hardware</p>
                                    <p>PCI-DSS: The business does not take card payments</p>
