															<p>This was an activity which was discussed with my team for this module. We had to discuss three questions based on secure programming languages </p>

																	<h3>Submission</h3>
																	<p><b>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</b><br>Cifuentes, C. & Bierman, G. (2019) describes a secure programming language as one that has first-class support for the main three categories of vulnerabilities:<br>- Buffer errors<br>- Injection errors<br>- Information leaks<br>They also say that vulnerable code is often written because mainstream programming languages do not provide the right abstractions to support developers in writing vulnerable-prone code.</p>
																	<p><b>Could Python be classified as a secure language?</b><br>If using the definition above, Python is not a secure language, as it does not offer first class support for any of the three categories. </p>
																	<p><b>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss</b><br>Python is written in C, so any fundamental flaws with C will be inherently included in Python. It can be argued that Python is easier for programmers to write in, as there is much more standardisation in Python, as well as superior abstraction. However, the biggest argument that C is superior for operating systems is resource consumption. In order for Python to run it needs an interpreter, which can be recourse intensive and is an additional requirement which is not needed for C. The interpreter will even need to be loaded by another language, such as C.
