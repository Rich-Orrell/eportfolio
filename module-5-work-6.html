																		<h3>Submission</h3>
																	<p>In order to manage an emotional customer we need to first understand what would make the customer emotional in relation to the software. The user's emotions are generally integrated into the subjective user experience, which would include the perceived instrumental and non-instrumental qualities ((Van der Linden 2019)), and all of these factors have an impact on the overall user experience. Whether the user is a customer or a user, communication and understanding of their concerns will go the longest way in resolving their negative reactions. This is key in agile software development, where strong customer involvement is thought of as one of the strongest success factors. Stakeholders need to know that their requirements have been acknowledged and are being addressed (Stellman, 2005), so demonstrating changes to them may be reassuring to an emotional customer.</p>
