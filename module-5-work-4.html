																		<h3>Submission</h3>
																		<p>Risks identified by the author:</p>
<p>•	Project complexity</p>
<p>•	Offshore projects can be unsuccessful because of physical, time, cultural, organisational distances can affect communication and knowledge exchange</p>
<p>•	Asymmetric in processes, policies, and standards</p>
<p>•	Lack of communication with stakeholders</p>
<p>•	Communication issues caused by large teams</p>


<p>I would use the ITIL framework to alleviate these issues. While it is typically used in an IT service management context, it can provide a set of standards to follow which can be translated into a software development project. Risk management is an integral part of ITIL, and this can be followed by teams whether they are small, large, or offshore. ITIL can be used in conjunction with Agile methodologies to streamline processes and set clear goals for the project.
